#Trajectory planning for UR3 robotic arm
-----------------------------------
Author: Junqi Ren (Karl)    
This package works on trajectory planning in Rviz and Gazebo for the 6 dof UR3 robotic arm. It works in Ubuntu 14.04 ROS Indigo. I also try to load the universal robot model and run the package in Ubuntu 16.04 ROS Kinetic but I met consecutive problems when I try to catkin make the original UR package and my own package. These problems are very common and a lof of engineers have also met these problems. I spent weeks but just only solved some of them. At last, I turned to Indigo and this time everything went smoothly. Thanks god.    
I will elaborate how to solve these problems
